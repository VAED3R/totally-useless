# BlindList üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Void Main


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jishnu Sursh - SCMS
- Member 2: Fathil P M - SCMS
- Member 3: Akshay Kumar M S - SCMS

### Project Description
BlindList: It‚Äôs like a to-do list, but you‚Äôre not allowed to know what‚Äôs on it. Finish random tasks, hope they‚Äôre the right ones, and maybe you'll accidentally get stuff done! 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
BlindList solves the devastating problem of knowing what you have to do. Why be burdened by the heavy knowledge of your own tasks? With BlindList, you can stumble into productivity without the pesky pressure of planning‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt want a little mystery in their Monday?







### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
BlindList solves it by turning your to-do list into a covert operation! You jot down your tasks, and we lock them away like classified files. The only way to unlock them? Complete random activities until‚Äîbam!‚Äîone of them matches. It‚Äôs like productivity karaoke: you don‚Äôt know the words, but you‚Äôre singing anyway. By the time you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôve been productive without even knowing what you set out to do!!
